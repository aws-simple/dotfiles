## Attempt to aproach to `dot files`

* The idea is based on [driesvints/dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) - see the details there till they appear here
* To install (fresh) or upgrade (existing) macOS `dot files` configuration, just run `upstall.sh` from the root of the repo after clonning it
